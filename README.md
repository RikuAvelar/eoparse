# Eoparse

An FFXI addon and external parser, using [MopiMopi](https://github.com/HAERUHAERU/mopimopi), [Parse](https://github.com/flippant/parse) and [Scoreboard](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/tree/live/addons/scoreboard) as its basis.

The addon works by emulating the packets expected by an FFXIV ACT-Websocket compliant UI using data from within FFXI.
